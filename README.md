<h1>Monty Hall</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

Project is based on the famous "Let's Make a Deal" show or the Monty Hall problem.


A bit of  context of the Monty Hall Problem:
The Monty Hall problem goes like this: You are a contestant on a game show. There are three curtains. Behind one of the curtains is a car, and behind the other two are tigers. You choose a curtain, and then the host opens one of the other two curtains, revealing a tiger. Now, you are given the option to either stick with your initial choice or switch to the other unreveiled curtain. The question is: What is the best strategy to maximize your chance of winning the car?

P3: This is a simulation of the 2000 Monty Hall games. It shows the user a graph of which strategy is the most effective. 

P2: Just like P1, an interactive game where the user participates in the show. This is a simulation of the actual show where the probabilities are calculated

P1: The script is an interactive game where the user participates in the show. This is the most basic version of the Game where the probabilities are preset.
